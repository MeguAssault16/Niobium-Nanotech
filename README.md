# Niobium Nanotech

This is a Mindustry .json mod based on a new custom ore, Niobium. It is intented to be a mid-upper tier extention of the vanilla content, balanced to provide modest damage at superior range while being vulnerable to force projectors. All sprites are made from scratch.

I plan to include an attack map to demonstrate the unique advantages/disadvantages of the turrets in the future.  More structures may also follow if I get into source modding or the .json capabilities are expanded.
